A reworking of the Congo project from second year. The basic idea for the project is the same but the way it is coded has been completely reworked to use more advanced techniques.

MVC Design Pattern including use of a Data Accessor Object (DAO) - The project follows the Model View Controller pattern.

Spring Framework - The project makes use of Spring Framework coding techniques

RESTful interface - Now the URL is more descriptive of the content and various search queries can be performed directly from the address bar.
